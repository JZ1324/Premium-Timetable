# URL Reference Fixes - Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Hardcoded Domain References**:
   - Updated `src/services/multiModelParser.js` to use `window.location.origin` instead of hardcoded domain
   - Updated test files to use a consistent non-production domain reference
   - Created a URL checker script (`check-hardcoded-urls.sh`) to verify all domain references are resolved

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Used `window.location.origin || "https://preview-domain.vercel.app"` pattern in all service files
   - This ensures that the HTTP-Referer header will use the current domain first
   - Fallback domain is only used when `window.location.origin` is not available

3. **Testing**:
   - Verified no hardcoded references to `timetable-premium.vercel.app` remain
   - Verified no references to `premium-timetable.vercel.app` remain
   - All service files now use dynamic detection for HTTP-Referer header

## Deployment Process

1. A new deployment has been triggered on Vercel by pushing these changes to GitHub
2. The preview URL should work as before
3. Once verified in preview, follow the instructions in `promote-to-production.md` to promote to production
4. The production URL should now work correctly without any domain-specific issues

## Additional Notes

- The `HTTP-Referer` header is important for API providers to validate request origins
- Dynamic URL detection ensures the application works correctly regardless of the deployment domain
- Using `window.location.origin` makes the application portable across all Vercel deployments and custom domains
- The backup files in `aiparser-backups` still contain old references but are not part of the active codebase
