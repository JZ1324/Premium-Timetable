   ./combined-fix-and-deploy.sh
   ```

Or, if you prefer to do it step-by-step:

1. Build the application:

   ```

2. Verify the build output:

   ```

4. Deploy to Vercel:

   ```

## üîç Verification Instructions

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Navigate to the sign-up page and test the visibility of the sign-up button:
   - Fill out all form fields
   - Verify that the 'Create Account' button remains visible with its green color
   - Complete the sign-up process to ensure it works end-to-end

3. Test the timetable day persistence:
   - Sign in to the application
   - Select a day in the timetable (not today's day)
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify that the same day is still selected
   - Close the browser and reopen the application to verify the persistence works across sessions

## üìã Additional Considerations

If issues persist:

- Test on different browsers and screen sizes
- Verify localStorage is working correctly by examining it in the browser developer tools
- Clear browser cache if old versions of files are being loaded
