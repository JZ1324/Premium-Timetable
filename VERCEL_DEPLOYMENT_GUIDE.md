# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying your Premium-Timetable application to Vercel and resolving the "Unexpected token '<'" error.

## Fixes Implemented

We've implemented multiple layers of fixes to ensure your app deploys correctly:

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Corrected Firebase version to 11.7.1
   - Fixed storage bucket format from `timetable-28639.firebasestorage.app` to `timetable-28639.appspot.com`

2. **Bundle.js Path Fixes**
   - Added path-fix.js and vercel-path-fix.js scripts to fix runtime path issues
   - Updated webpack configuration to use proper publicPath settings
   - Configured Vercel routing with correct content types and cache headers

3. **Webpack Enhancements**
   - Added hash to bundle filename for cache busting
   - Improved HTML and script injection settings
   - Updated copy plugin to include all necessary static files

4. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Created enhanced build process in vercel.build.js
   - Added final-build-check.sh to validate and fix any remaining issues

## Deployment Process

Follow these steps to deploy your application:

### 1. Test Locally First

```bash
# Run the test deployment script
./test-deployment.sh
```

This will:
- Build your project with production settings
- Run the final build checks and fixes
- Start a local server at http://localhost:3333
- Show detailed logs for debugging

### 2. Check for Any Issues

While testing locally:
- Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for any errors
- Verify that bundle.js loads correctly (no 404 errors)
- Make sure Firebase initializes properly

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

Once your local testing is successful:

```bash
# Run the Vercel deployment script
./vercel-deploy.sh

# Then deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter the "Unexpected token '<'" error:

1. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for 404 errors when loading bundle.js
   - Verify the Content-Type is "application/javascript"

2. **Inspect the HTML**:
   - Make sure script tags use absolute paths (`/bundle.js` not `./bundle.js`)
   - Confirm the path-fix scripts are loaded before any other scripts

3. **Try Manual Fix**:
   - Add `?v=xyz` to the bundle.js URL in your HTML to bypass caching
   - Clear your browser cache completely

## Files Modified

The following files were modified to fix the deployment issues:

- webpack.config.js - Enhanced build configuration
- public/index.html - Added path fixing scripts
- public/path-fix.js - Runtime path fixing
- public/vercel-path-fix.js - Vercel-specific fixes
- vercel.json - Improved routing configuration
- vercel-build.js - Enhanced build process
- vercel-build.sh - Updated build script
- vercel-deploy.sh - Deployment script
- test-deployment.sh - Local testing script
- final-build-check.sh - Final verification and fixes

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Test the application on Vercel
2. Verify all features work correctly
3. If issues persist, check the Vercel logs and browser console
