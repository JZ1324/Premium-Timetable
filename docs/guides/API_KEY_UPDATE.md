# API Key Update - May 17, 2025

## Enhancement: Added Third API Key

To further improve the reliability of the OpenRouter API integration for timetable parsing, a third API key has been added to the rotation system. This provides additional fallback protection when token limits are reached.

### Update Details

The API key array has been expanded to include three keys:

```javascript
const API_KEYS = [
  "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", // Primary key
  "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", // Second backup key 
  "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"  // Third backup key
];
```

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Reliability**
   - The system now has three API keys, giving it more capacity before running into token limits
   - Each key has its own daily token limit of 1000 tokens, resulting in a combined capacity of 3000 tokens per day

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Even during periods of heavy usage, the system is less likely to encounter token limit errors
   - Users should experience consistent performance throughout the day

3. **Token Management**
   - Keys are used in sequence (primary first, then backups) to ensure optimal usage

### Files Updated

- `/Users/joshuazheng/Downloads/Vscode/timetable premium/Premium-Timetable/API_TOKEN_LIMIT_HANDLING.md`

### No Code Changes Required

The existing key rotation system already supports multiple keys without limitation, so no additional code changes were needed beyond adding the new key to the array.
