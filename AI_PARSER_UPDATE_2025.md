# AI Parser Model and Prompt Update

## Changes Made

1. **Updated AI Model**
   - Changed from `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` to `meta-llama/llama-3.3-8b-instruct:free`
   - The new model is the latest in the Llama 3 series, offering good performance despite the smaller parameter count
   - Using the free tier to reduce costs while maintaining quality

2. **Simplified Prompt**
   - Streamlined the prompt to be more direct and focused
   - Reduced repetitive instructions
   - Maintained clear guidance on the expected JSON structure
   - Emphasized the importance of organizing classes by day and period
   - Included warnings about common mistakes (e.g., grouping all Period 1 classes together)

3. **JSON Structure**
   - Kept the same JSON structure for compatibility
   - Maintained support for multiple classes per period
   - Ensured all necessary fields are included in each class entry

## Benefits of the Update

1. **Cost Efficiency**
   - The free tier model reduces operational costs
   - Smaller model requires fewer tokens, potentially allowing more timetables to be processed

2. **Improved Parsing**
   - More focused instructions should lead to better parsing results
   - Clear warnings about common mistakes should reduce parsing errors
   - Simplified prompt reduces the chance of conflicting instructions

3. **Future Compatibility**
   - Using the latest model ensures better long-term support
   - The 3.3 series has improved instruction following compared to earlier models

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various timetable formats to ensure the new model and prompt handle them correctly
2. Pay special attention to timetables with multiple classes per period
3. Compare parsing results with the previous implementation to ensure quality is maintained

## Next Steps

If the new model proves effective, consider:
1. Fine-tuning the prompt further based on any parsing errors encountered
2. Exploring additional optimization opportunities
3. Implementing adaptive model selection based on timetable complexity
