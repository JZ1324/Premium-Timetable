# OpenRouter API Error Handling Update

## Problem Summary

The AI parser in the Premium Timetable application was encountering errors when trying to use the OpenRouter API with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Users were seeing error messages like "Provider returned error" or "Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day" when attempting to parse timetable data.

## Diagnosis

After running diagnostic tests, we identified the following issues:

1. **Rate Limiting**: The application was hitting the free-tier usage limits on OpenRouter, which allows only 50 free requests per day.

2. **Provider Errors**: When OpenRouter tried to forward requests to Google's Gemini API, it sometimes received errors from the provider.

3. **API Key Management**: The application was not efficiently managing API key usage or falling back to alternative keys when one failed.

4. **Model Availability**: Some models specified in the application were no longer available or had ID changes.

## Solution

We implemented a multi-layered solution to handle these issues:

### 1. Multi-Model Fallback System

- Created a new service (`multiModelParser.js`) that tries multiple AI models in sequence when one fails
- Priority is given to free models first, then falling back to paid models only when necessary
- The system includes models from different providers (Google/Gemini, Anthropic/Claude, Mistral) for maximum reliability

### 2. Enhanced Error Diagnostics

- Added detailed error diagnosis capabilities to detect specific types of errors:
  - Rate limiting errors
  - Provider-specific errors
  - Authentication issues
  - Token limit issues

- Each error diagnosis includes:
  - Possible causes
  - Recommended actions
  - Severity level

### 3. Improved User Experience

- Updated the ImportTimetable component to:
  - Show which model was successfully used
  - Provide clearer error messages when parsing fails
  - Display helpful recommendations to users

### 4. API Validation

- Created test scripts to verify API connectivity and model availability
- Fixed incorrect model IDs that were no longer valid with OpenRouter

## Technical Details

### API Rate Limiting

OpenRouter imposes the following limits:
- Free tier: 50 requests per day for free models
- Paid tier: Based on credits added to the account

When the rate limit is exceeded, OpenRouter returns:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day. Add 10 credits to unlock 1000 free model requests per day",
    "code": 429
  }
}
```

### Model Fallback Sequence

The application now tries models in this order:
1. `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` (Free tier)
2. `google/gemini-flash-1.5` (Paid tier)
3. `mistralai/mistral-small` (Paid tier)
4. `anthropic/claude-instant-v1.2` (Paid tier)
5. `google/gemini-pro-1.5` (Paid tier)

### Testing

The solution has been tested with various error scenarios:
- Rate limiting errors
- Provider errors 
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid model IDs

In all cases, the system successfully falls back to alternative models or provides clear error information.

## Future Improvements

1. **Local Fallback Parser**: Implement a basic client-side parser for when all API options fail
2. **Usage Tracking**: Add metrics to track API usage and model success rates
3. **User Selection**: Allow users to select which model they prefer to use
4. **Credit System**: Implement a system for users to add their own API keys or credits

## Status

This solution is now implemented and ready for deployment. The multi-model fallback system successfully handles OpenRouter API errors and provides a more reliable timetable parsing experience for users.
