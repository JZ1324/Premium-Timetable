# AI Parser OpenRouter Gemini Fix - Summary

## Issue
The application was encountering "Provider returned error" when using OpenRouter API with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for timetable parsing.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Fallback Model System**
   - Primary model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`
   - Fallback model: `google/gemini-pro-1.5:free` 

2. **Improved API Request Structure**
   - Added a dedicated function `makeParserRequest` to handle API requests
   - Added system message for better context
   - Simplified content structure to match Gemini requirements
   - Set response format to `json_object`
   - Added temperature and max_tokens parameters for better control

3. **Enhanced Response Handling**
   - Added support for various API response structures
   - Added better error detection and reporting
   - Improved content extraction logic
   - Added proper validation of parsed data

4. **Improved JSON Parsing**
   - Better handling of markdown code blocks
   - JSON string cleaning and fixing for malformed responses
   - Validation of the normalized response structure
   - Better error reporting with content snippets

5. **Added Backup Functionality**
   - Automatic backup creation in Node.js environments
   - Timestamped backups for easy recovery

## Tutorial Period Inclusion
The existing prompt already correctly specified the need to include Tutorial periods between Period 2 and Period 3, with proper timing of 10:45am-11:20am. This was validated and maintained.

## Testing
The implementation includes test scripts to verify the fixes work correctly. These tests check both for successful API communication and for the proper inclusion of Tutorial periods in the parsed data.

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with real application data
2. Monitor for any additional edge cases or response format issues
3. Ensure the prompt emphasis on Tutorial periods is sufficient for consistent results
