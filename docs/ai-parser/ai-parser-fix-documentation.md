# AI Parser Enhancement Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The AI parser was failing with the error: `TypeError: this.enhanceClassData is not a function` when attempting to parse timetable data. This method was being called in multiple places in the AI Parser service but was not implemented.

## Root Cause
The `enhanceClassData` method was referenced in the `parseTimeTable` method and other places in `aiParserService.js` but was not actually implemented. This caused errors when the method was called during the timetable parsing process.

## Solution
The `enhanceClassData` method was implemented in the `AiParserService` class with the following key features:

1. Day name standardization - Maps various day name formats to a consistent "Day X" format
2. Period time filling - Ensures each period has the correct start and end times
3. Class structure initialization - Creates the proper structure for timetable data
4. Special handling for PST (Private Study) subjects - Adds a displaySubject field

## Implementation Details

The method performs these key steps:
- Creates a deep copy to avoid modifying the original data
- Standardizes day names using the cleanupDayHeaders method
- Ensures periods have complete time information
- Initializes the classes structure for all days and periods
- Creates a mapping between original and standardized day names
- Processes each class to ensure it has all required fields
- Adds 'Private Study' as displaySubject for PST subjects

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Unit tests verifying day name standardization
- Tests confirming period time information is properly filled in
- Tests validating PST subjects are correctly transformed
- Integration tests confirming the method works in the context of the parser

## Performance Impact
The enhancement adds minimal processing overhead, primarily when standardizing day names and updating class information. This is insignificant compared to the parsing operations themselves.

## Additional Notes
- The original error has been resolved, and the parser now correctly processes timetable data
- The implementation is robust to handle various edge cases like missing data
- Special handling for PST subjects improves the user experience by displaying "Private Study" instead of the acronym
