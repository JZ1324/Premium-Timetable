   - Integrated with the build process via fix-html-on-build.js

3. **Build Process Improvements** ✅
   - Updated postbuild script to handle _redirects file properly
   - Prevented directory/file conflicts during build
   - Fixed webpack configuration for proper output

4. **Vercel Configuration** ✅
   - Updated vercel.json for optimal deployment
