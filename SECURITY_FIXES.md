### 3. Code Changes Made

#### React 18 Migration
- Updated `src/index.js` to use React 18's `createRoot` API instead of deprecated `ReactDOM.render`

#### Security Best Practices
- Removed hardcoded API key from `webpack.config.js`
- Ensured all sensitive environment variables are properly configured
- Maintained existing `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files

#### Webpack Configuration
- Simplified webpack optimization to ensure stable builds
- Updated output configuration for webpack 5 compatibility
- Disabled complex code splitting that was causing build conflicts

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ All webpack warnings are non-critical (bundle size warnings only)
- ✅ Post-build scripts execute correctly

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data uses environment variables
2. **Package Management**: All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
3. **Build Process**: Simplified and secured webpack configuration
4. **Git Security**: Proper `.gitignore` prevents sensitive file commits

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Updates**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update packages
2. **Environment Management**: Keep `.env` files secure and never commit them
3. **Dependency Monitoring**: Consider using tools like Dependabot for automated security updates
4. **Code Reviews**: Review any new dependencies before adding them to the project

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Verify build works
npm run build

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

All commands should show no critical issues after these fixes.
