# GitHub Pages Deployment - Summary of Changes

## Router Configuration
- Created a new Router component in `src/components/Router.js`
- Implemented conditional routing using HashRouter for GitHub Pages and BrowserRouter for other environments
- Ensured correct base path configuration for GitHub Pages

## Routing Utilities
- Updated `src/utils/githubPagesRouting.js` to properly handle route parameters
- Added a `getBasePath()` function to consistently handle base paths

## Webpack Configuration
- Configured `publicPath` in webpack.config.js to properly handle GitHub Pages URL structure
- Set up copy plugins to include all necessary assets in the build

## 404 Handling
- Updated `public/404.html` to redirect to the appropriate URL format for GitHub Pages
- Implemented hash-based routing to avoid path-based 404 errors

## Build Process
- Created a `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub Pages from using Jekyll processing
- Added GitHub Actions workflow improvements for automated deployments

## Deployment Tools
- Created `deploy-to-github-pages.sh` script to simplify the deployment process
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  - `COMPLETE_GITHUB_PAGES_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment instructions
  - `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md` - Checklist for verifying deployment
  - `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step manual deployment process

## Next Steps
1. Commit all these changes to your main branch
2. Run the deployment script: `./deploy-to-github-pages.sh`
3. Follow the verification steps in `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`
4. Once deployed, your site will be available at: https://jz1324.github.io/timetables/
