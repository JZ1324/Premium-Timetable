# JSON Parser Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the significant enhancements made to the JSON timetable parser to handle various edge cases and ensure robust parsing of AI-generated responses.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Markdown Code Block Handling
- Automatically detects and extracts content from markdown code blocks
- Supports various code block formats: ```json, ```js, ```javascript, etc.
- Removes markdown syntax that would otherwise cause parse errors

### 2. JSON Preprocessing
- Fixes common JSON syntax errors before parsing:
  - Unquoted property names → Properly quoted names
  - Single quotes → Double quotes
  - Trailing commas → Removed
  - HTML/XML tags → Removed

### 3. Multi-Strategy JSON Extraction
- **Strategy 1:** Direct parsing of preprocessed text
- **Strategy 2:** Extract content between outermost braces
- **Strategy 3:** Find any JSON-like structure
- **Strategy 4:** Extract balanced brace subsets
- **Strategy 5:** Aggressive JSON repair with template structure

### 4. Key Name Normalization
- Handles API inconsistencies by normalizing key names
- Converts singular forms to plural when needed:
  - "day" → "days"
  - "period" → "periods"
  - "class" → "classes"

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Provides specific, actionable error messages
- Includes suggestions for alternate import methods
- Detects common issues like missing quotes, invalid syntax, etc.
- Shows diagnostic information to help with debugging

### 6. JSON Structure Validation
- Validates that the parsed JSON has the required structure:
  - Array of days
  - Array of periods
  - Object of classes with proper nesting

## Specific Issues Fixed

### Gemini Response Format Support
- Adds support for the specific response format from Gemini models
- Properly handles the content structure returned by OpenRouter

### Malformed JSON Repair
- Implements an aggressive JSON repair mechanism for severely damaged JSON
- Attempts to reconstruct timetable structure from partial matches

### Empty or Incomplete Response Handling
- Properly handles empty responses
- Detects incomplete data structures and provides helpful error messages

## Usage
The enhanced parser is used in the ImportTimetable component and provides a robust way to handle various JSON formats and potential issues that may arise when parsing timetable data.

## Testing
Manual testing has been performed with various input formats:
- Valid JSON
- JSON with syntax errors
- Markdown code blocks
- Partial JSON structures
- Empty or malformed responses

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- More sophisticated template-based repair for specific class structure issues
- Integration with custom templating for consistent display of error messages
- Interactive "format fixer" for user-assisted repair of invalid JSON
