# OpenRouter API Implementation Update for Gemini Model

## Summary of Changes
This document outlines the simplified implementation of the OpenRouter API integration with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for timetable parsing.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Simplified API Request Structure**
   - Updated to match OpenRouter's recommended format for Gemini models
   - Removed unnecessary parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens`
   - Combined prompt and user input in a single message

2. **Streamlined Response Processing**
   - Focused on the standard OpenAI-compatible response format
   - Improved JSON extraction from content
   - Added handling for markdown-formatted responses

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error reporting for API failures
   - Clearer messages for unexpected response structures
   - Added more context in error logs

## Implementation Details

The implementation now follows the exact format recommended by OpenRouter for the Gemini model:

```javascript
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
    "HTTP-Referer": "https://timetable-premium.vercel.app", 
    "X-Title": "Premium Timetable App",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "...[prompt + timetable data]..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
})
```

## Final Notes

This implementation is simpler and more aligned with OpenRouter's recommended practices for the Gemini model. The code has been tested to ensure it properly processes API responses and handles errors gracefully.
