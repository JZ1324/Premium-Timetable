# AI Parser Enhancement: Multiple Classes Per Period

## Feature Overview

This update enhances the Premium Timetable application's AI parser to better handle timetable formats where multiple classes can occur during the same period. This is particularly important for schools where different student groups attend different classes simultaneously.

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. AI Prompt Optimization

The prompt for the AI parser now explicitly instructs the model to:
- Include ALL classes that happen in a given period
- List multiple classes for a single period when applicable
- Group classes by day first, then by period
- Preserve all entries when multiple classes exist in the same period

### 2. Enhanced Class Redistribution Logic

The `redistributeClasses` function has been significantly improved to:
- Detect and preserve multi-class periods during redistribution
- Only redistribute single classes when necessary
- Add duplicate detection to prevent redundant entries
- Use a more accurate heuristic for when redistribution is needed
- Pass text length as a parameter for better decision-making

### 3. Tabular Format Parser Enhancements

A dedicated tabular format parser has been added that:
- Processes multiple rows of classes for the same period
- Properly parses each cell as a potential class
- Maps each column to the corresponding day
- Preserves the relationship between multiple classes in the same period
- Handles various delimiters (tabs, pipes, multiple spaces)

### 4. Fallback Parser Improvements

The fallback parser now:
- Checks for different teachers/rooms when the same subject appears multiple times
- Handles tabular formats more intelligently
- Applies the improved class redistribution logic to its output
- Performs deduplication to avoid identical class entries

## Implementation Details

1. Technical changes to `redistributeClasses`:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   if (classes.length > 1) {
     // Simply redistribute all classes
   }
   
   // After
   if (classes.length > 1) {
     // Keep multi-class periods intact
     console.log(`Preserving ${classes.length} classes in Day 1 ${period} as a multi-class period`);
     // Only redistribute single-class periods
   }
   ```

2. Added enhanced tabular parser:
   ```javascript
   const parseTabularPeriod = (periodIndex, lines, startLineIndex, dayHeaders) => {
     // Logic to handle multiple rows of classes for the same period
     // Each row represents additional classes in the same period
   }
   ```

3. Duplicate detection:
   ```javascript
   const isDuplicate = jsonObject.classes[targetDay][period].some(existingClass => 
     existingClass.subject === cls.subject && 
     existingClass.room === cls.room && 
     existingClass.teacher === cls.teacher
   );
   
   if (!isDuplicate) {
     // Add class to the period
   }
   ```

## Testing

A test suite has been created to validate these changes:
- `test-multiclass-parser.js` - Node.js test script
- `multiClassTests.js` - Sample test cases with various formats
- `multiClassTestRunner.js` - Test runner with output analytics

The tests verify that:
1. Multiple classes per period are correctly identified
2. Classes are grouped by day and period
3. No duplicates are created during parsing
4. Various timetable formats are handled properly

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x test-multiclass-parser.sh

# Run the tests
./test-multiclass-parser.sh
```

## Future Improvements

1. Further refinement of the tabular format parser to handle more complex layouts
2. Additional heuristics to identify student groups when that information is available
3. Better handling of merged cells in tabular formats
4. Integration with a test suite that runs during the build process
