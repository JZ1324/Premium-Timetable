# AI Parser JSON Handling Improvements

This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to the Premium Timetable AI parser service to handle various JSON parsing issues, with a special focus on Gemini model integration with OpenRouter API.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Truncation**: Fixed the "unterminated string" error at position 10982 with Gemini models
2. **Model Fallback**: Enhanced provider error handling with intelligent model switching
3. **API Key Rotation**: Improved token limit detection and key rotation system
4. **JSON Reconstruction**: Added multi-stage JSON recovery strategies for various error types

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced JSON Truncation Handling

The primary issue was Gemini models returning truncated JSON responses, typically around position 10982. We implemented a specialized detection and repair system:

- **Truncation Detection**: Added pattern recognition for common truncation points (especially in class "code" fields)
- **Partial Data Recovery**: Implemented multiple strategies to extract valid data from truncated responses
- **Structure Completion**: Added logic to properly close JSON objects and arrays to maintain valid structure
- **Position-Based Analysis**: Used error position information to locate and target repair efforts

This eliminates the "unterminated string" error that previously occurred with the OpenRouter API when using Gemini models.

#### Specialized English Class Truncation Fix

We implemented a dedicated fix for the most common truncation pattern, which occurs with English class entries:

- **Pattern**: `"subject": "English", "code": "(10EN` typically truncates at position ~10982
- **Solution**: Added `EnglishTruncationFix.js` module with specialized pattern detection and repair
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Early detection before general JSON error handling
  - Enhanced pattern detection in the truncation section
  - Specialized handling within reconstruction strategies

The fix has been thoroughly tested with various English class truncation scenarios and significantly improves the parser's reliability with Gemini 2.0 Flash. See `ENGLISH_TRUNCATION_FIX.md` for detailed documentation.

### 2. Intelligent Model Fallback System

Enhanced the model fallback system with smarter error analysis:

- **Provider-Specific Detection**: Added specific detection patterns for Gemini model errors
- **Targeted Fallback**: When Gemini-specific errors occur, system now skips to non-Gemini models
- **Model State Tracking**: Added tracking of failed models to avoid retrying models known to fail
- **Multi-Stage Fallback**: Implemented cascading fallback that considers both error types and model capabilities

This resolves the "Provider returned error" issues when using OpenRouter API with Gemini models.

### 3. Advanced API Key Management

The API token limit handling has been significantly improved:

- **Key Exhaustion Tracking**: Added a system to track which API keys have hit their token limits
- **Intelligent Key Selection**: System now starts with non-exhausted keys when available
- **Enhanced Limit Detection**: Expanded detection patterns for token limit and rate limit errors
- **Reset Strategy**: When all keys are exhausted, system switches models and resets to first key

This gives the system effective access to the combined daily token allocation of all configured API keys (3000 tokens/day with current setup).

### 4. Multi-Stage JSON Recovery

Implemented a sophisticated multi-stage approach to JSON recovery:

1. **Basic Cleaning**: Fix common syntax issues like trailing commas and unquoted property names
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Extract critical structural components (days, periods, classes)
3. **Partial Structure**: Build valid partial timetable with the successfully extracted sections
4. **Balance Completion**: Add missing closing braces, brackets and quotes to balance the structure
5. **Fallback Structure**: If extraction fails, fall back to a minimal valid structure with available data

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a progressive enhancement strategy:

1. Try simple fixes first (cleaning up common JSON syntax issues)
2. If that fails, attempt to extract key structural elements
3. If the structure is valid but incomplete, extract as much data as possible
4. If extraction is partial, create a valid structure with the available data
5. If all reconstruction fails, provide a minimal valid structure

## Testing

The changes have been tested against various error scenarios:

1. **Truncated JSON**: Successfully recovers partial data from truncated responses
2. **Provider Errors**: Properly falls back to alternative models when provider errors occur
3. **Token Limits**: Correctly detects and handles token limit errors with key rotation
4. **Combined Issues**: Successfully handles scenarios where multiple issues occur together

## Conclusion

These improvements make the AI parser service significantly more robust against common failure modes, particularly with the OpenRouter API and Gemini models. The system can now handle truncated responses, provider errors, and token limits elegantly, ensuring users get usable timetable data even when the underlying API services encounter issues.
