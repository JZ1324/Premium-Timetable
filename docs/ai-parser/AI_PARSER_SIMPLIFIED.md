# AI Parser Simplification - May 17, 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Fallback Model Mechanism**
   - Simplified to use only the primary Gemini 2.0 Flash model
   - Removed the makeParserRequest function and related code
   
2. **Fixed Browser Compatibility Issues**
   - Removed Node.js-specific modules (`fs/promises` and `path`)
   - Replaced file system backup with browser-compatible logging

3. **Maintained Key Improvements**
   - Kept enhanced response handling for different formats
   - Maintained JSON extraction and validation logic
   - Preserved specific instructions for Tutorial periods
   
4. **Updated Test Files**
   - Created proper ES module test file
   - Simplified test logic for easier execution

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Build Errors**
   - Removed modules that caused "Module not found" errors:
     - `fs/promises`
     - `path`
   - Eliminated webpack compatibility issues

2. **Simplified Logic**
   - Removed unnecessary complexity with fallback models
   - Streamlined error handling
   - Made code more maintainable

3. **Maintained Functionality**
   - Preserved Tutorial period handling
   - Kept enhanced JSON extraction
   - Maintained error reporting
   
## Files Modified

- `/Users/joshuazheng/Downloads/Vscode/timetable premium/Premium-Timetable/src/services/aiParserService.js`
- Renamed `/Users/joshuazheng/Downloads/Vscode/timetable premium/Premium-Timetable/test-ai-parser-cjs.js` to `test-ai-parser.mjs`

## Testing

The updated implementation can be tested using:

```bash
node test-ai-parser.mjs
```

This will test the parser with a sample timetable that includes Tutorial periods to verify that everything is working correctly.
