# GitHub Pages Deployment Verification

This document provides instructions for verifying your GitHub Pages deployment at https://jz1324.github.io/timetables/.

## Deployment Steps Completed

1. **Repository Configuration**:
   - Repository URL: https://github.com/JZ1324/timetables.git
   - Branch for GitHub Pages: `gh-pages`

2. **Package Configuration**:
   - Added `homepage` field to package.json
   - Updated deployment scripts
   - Created .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll processing

3. **Routing Configuration**:
   - Implemented HashRouter for GitHub Pages to avoid 404 errors
   - Created utility functions for GitHub Pages routing
   - Updated 404.html for GitHub Pages redirection

## Verifying Your Deployment

1. **Check the Repository**:
   - Visit https://github.com/JZ1324/timetables
   - Go to Settings > Pages to verify GitHub Pages is enabled
   - Confirm it's using the `gh-pages` branch

2. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Visit https://jz1324.github.io/timetables/
   - The application should load without errors
   - Test navigation between different routes

3. **Test Direct URL Access**:
   - Try accessing a direct route like: https://jz1324.github.io/timetables/#/settings
   - The application should navigate to the appropriate page

4. **Check Different Browsers**:
   - Test the application in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Test on mobile devices if possible

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **404 Errors**:
   - If you see 404 errors, check that HashRouter is correctly implemented
   - Verify the 404.html redirect script is working

2. **Blank Page**:
   - If you see a blank page, check browser console for errors
   - Common issues include path problems or CORS issues

3. **Asset Loading Failures**:
   - Check that asset paths are relative or use the correct base path
   - Verify that themes and images are loading properly

## Deployment Updates

When you make changes to your code:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Create .nojekyll file:
   ```bash
   touch build/.nojekyll
   ```

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:github
   ```

Or use the automated script:
```bash
./deploy-github-pages-auto.sh
```
