# AI Parser Syntax Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. Removed stray semicolon (`;`) after the closing brace of the `parseTimetableText` function
2. Fixed a duplicate `try` block around the line-by-line parser section
3. Ensured proper matching of try/catch blocks throughout the file

These fixes resolved the syntax errors that were preventing the code from compiling properly.

## Validation

The fixes were verified using:
- `node --check` to verify JavaScript syntax
- Manual inspection of key areas of the code

## Date

Fixed on: May 16, 2025
