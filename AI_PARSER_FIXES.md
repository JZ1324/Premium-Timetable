# AI Parser Fixes Summary

## Latest Update (May 2025): Browser Compatibility Fixes
1. Fixed `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error in apiKeyManager.js by removing process.env references
2. Added safety checks for window.location.origin in API headers
3. Enhanced streaming response handling with better error recovery
4. Updated OpenRouter API key management to work in all environments

## Previous Update (May 2025): Migration to OpenRouter.ai
1. Migrated from Together.ai to OpenRouter.ai API
2. Removed Together.ai SDK dependency and implemented native fetch API
3. Updated streaming response handling for OpenRouter's SSE format
4. Modified API key management for OpenRouter
5. Enhanced error handling patterns to match OpenRouter's response format
6. Updated model selection to use `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`

## Previous Issues Fixed
1. Fixed the error: `(0 , _services_aiParserService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.parseWithAI) is not a function`
2. Updated the AI prompt to be more specific and optimized for JSON generation
3. Updated period structure to match requirements (removed Recess and Lunch periods)
4. Added proper fallbackParser export 
5. Set model to `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` (full model rather than Turbo version)
6. Improved prompt clarity and instructions for better AI responses
7. Fixed issue where only Days 1-5 appear in the "classes" object instead of all 10 days (Day 1 to Day 10)
8. Fixed JSON parsing error: `Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 101`
9. Fixed JSON parsing error: `Expected ',' or '}' after property value in JSON at position 145`
10. Fixed syntax errors in the aiParserService.js file
11. Enhanced prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to extract all subject information
12. Removed "Tutorial" period from periods list to match required output schema
13. Improved prompt with clear instructions to populate classes with actual data
14. Fixed token limit error when parsing large timetables (Input validation error: tokens + max_new_tokens must be <= 8193)
15. Added intelligent class redistribution when AI places all classes in Day 1 instead of distributing them

## Changes Made

1. Browser Compatibility Fixes (May 2025):
   - Removed `process.env` reference in apiKeyManager.js to fix browser environment errors
   - Added safety checks for `window.location.origin` to ensure it works in all environments
   - Enhanced streaming response handling with better error recovery and fallback mechanisms
   - Improved API key management to work reliably in browser environments

2. OpenRouter.ai Migration Changes (May 2025):
   - Replaced Together.ai SDK with native fetch API calls
   - Updated API key management to handle OpenRouter keys
   - Modified streaming response handling for Server-Sent Events (SSE) format
   - Enhanced error handling for OpenRouter-specific errors
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   - Kept the same high-quality prompt structure that works well

2. Previous Changes:
   - Fixed import/export discrepancy:
     - Aliased `parseTimetableText` to `parseWithAI` in the ImportTimetable.js imports
     - Added explicit `fallbackParser` export function
   - Improved AI Prompts:
     - Updated to use the "JSON-structure generator" description
     - Added clearer instructions about return format
     - Removed unnecessary instructions about Recess and Lunch periods
     - Enhanced prompt with more explicit instructions about day distribution
     - Added CRITICAL warning about not placing all classes in Day 1
     - Added specific instructions to look for day patterns in the text
   - **Enhanced prompt to use a pure JSON-focused instruction set**
   - **Added more explicit formatting guidelines with better examples**
   - **Added triple emphasis on NOT returning function wrappers or markdown**

3. Updated Default Structure:
   - Updated days array to include 10 days
   - Updated periods list to match requirements
   - Removed Recess and Lunch from period lists
   - Updated fallback parser to handle new structure
   - **Updated default structure to include Days 1-10 in the classes object** (previously only had Days 1-5)
   - **Fixed syntax errors in helper function structure**

4. API Call Improvements:
   - Updated model to full Llama 3.3 70B (removing "Turbo-Free" for better comprehension)
   - Reduced temperature to 0 for completely deterministic output (previously 0.1)
   - Implemented streaming approach with Together AI (`stream: true`) to avoid JSON parsing errors
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Added validation to detect and fix missing days in the returned JSON
   - Added special handling for array syntax errors
   - **Adjusted max_tokens to 5900 to stay within API constraints (previously 7000)**
   - **Fixed compatibility with newer Together AI API**
   - **Implemented token-by-token collection in streaming mode for better parsing**
   - **Added special handling for token limit errors with automatic fallback to heuristic parser**
   - **Added intelligent pattern-based class redistribution across days**

5. Enhanced JSON Parsing:
   - Added 15+ specialized JSON-fixing functions to address common AI response errors
   - Added special fix for position 101 error in array elements
   - Added direct replacement of the days array when needed
   - Added fixes for double quotes in array elements like `"Day 10""`
   - Added detailed logging for debugging error cases
   - Enhanced regex patterns to fix malformatted arrays
   - Added sanitation of non-string elements in arrays
   - Added custom array validation logic
   - Improved error recovery mechanisms
   - Added cascade of increasingly aggressive fixes for problematic JSON
   - **Added integration with jsonSanitizer module for deeper sanitization**
   - **Fixed file structure and syntax issues in the main parser code**
   - **Added post-processing to redistribute classes when all are in Day 1**
   - **Enhanced day detection in the fallback parser with multiple patterns**

These changes resolve the parsing errors and ensure that all 10 days are properly included in the AI-generated timetable structure with improved error handling.
