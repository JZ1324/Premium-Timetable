# How to Promote Your Preview Deployment to Production

When your preview deployment works correctly but the production URL isn't updated, you need to promote the deployment to production. Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Through Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project "premium-timetable"
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Find your latest working deployment (the one with the URL: https://premium-timetable-git-main-jzs-projects-88f4a016.vercel.app/)
5. Click on the three dots menu (â‹®) next to this deployment
6. Select "Promote to Production"
7. Confirm the promotion

## Option 2: Using Vercel CLI

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login to your Vercel account
vercel login

# List deployments to find the deployment ID
vercel ls premium-timetable

# Promote specific deployment to production
vercel promote <deployment-id>
```

Note: Your production URL will be automatically updated once the promotion is complete. It might take a few minutes for the changes to propagate worldwide.

## Why This Happens

Vercel uses a preview deployment system where:
- Each git push creates a new preview deployment with a unique URL
- The production domain only updates when you specifically promote a deployment to production
- This workflow lets you test changes before they go live to all users

Your fixes are working correctly in the preview deployment, which confirms our changes are successful. Now you just need to promote this deployment to production.
