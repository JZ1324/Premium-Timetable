# Multiple Classes Per Period Feature Update

## Overview

This update enhances the Premium Timetable application to better handle timetable formats where multiple classes can occur during the same period. This is a common scenario in schools where different students attend different classes in the same timeslot.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt

The AI parser prompt has been updated to explicitly instruct the model to:
- Include ALL classes that happen in a given period
- Group classes by day first, then by period
- List multiple classes for a single period when applicable
- Include all entries for a single period in the classes array

### 2. Smarter Class Redistribution

The `redistributeClasses` function now:
- Preserves multiple classes in a period that were already correctly grouped
- Only redistributes single-class periods when a redistribution is needed
- Avoids duplicating classes when redistributing
- Adds safety checks for duplicate detection
- Creates a more accurate heuristic for when redistribution is needed

### 3. Improved Fallback Parser

The fallback parser now:
- Properly detects when multiple entries for the same subject exist in a period
- Checks for different teachers or rooms to determine if they're separate class offerings
- Applies the improved class redistribution logic to its output
- Handles tabular formats better by preserving columns as separate classes

### 4. Deduplication Logic

The parser now includes logic to:
- Keep multiple classes in the same period when they have different subjects, teachers, or rooms
- Deduplicate identical classes that may have been erroneously duplicated
- Create a unique key for each class based on subject, room, and teacher

## Implementation Details

1. For the AI parser:
   - Example JSON structure shows multiple classes in Period 1 of Day 1
   - Instructions explicitly mention handling multiple classes per period

2. For redistribution logic:
   - When multiple classes exist in a period in Day 1, they're preserved as a multi-class period
   - Single classes are redistributed based on metadata or position in the original data
   - A final pass ensures there are no duplicates in multi-class periods

3. For the fallback parser:
   - Looks for different teachers/rooms for the same subject to detect multiple class offerings
   - Uses a more sophisticated approach to match classes to their proper day and period

## Testing Notes

When testing this feature, try different formats of timetables where:
1. Multiple teachers teach the same subject in different rooms during the same period
2. Different subjects are offered in the same period (electives or streaming)
3. Tabular formats where days are columns and periods are rows

The parser should now correctly identify and group these classes within the same period rather than spreading them across multiple days or periods.
