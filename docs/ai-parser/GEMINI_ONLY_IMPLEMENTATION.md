# Gemini 2.0 Flash Only Implementation

## Overview

This documentation explains the transition from a multi-model implementation to using exclusively the Gemini 2.0 Flash model in the Premium Timetable AI Parser service.

## Changes Made

1. **Single Model Configuration**
   - Removed alternative models (Claude, Mistral)
   - Now exclusively using `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`
   - Simplified model selection and fallback logic

2. **Updated Error Handling**
   - Modified provider error handling to focus on API key rotation
   - Removed model fallback strategies
   - Enhanced API key rotation logic for Gemini-specific errors

3. **Token Limit Management**
   - Maintained existing multi-API key rotation system
   - System will cycle through all available API keys on token limit errors
   - Enhanced tracking of exhausted keys

## Rationale

1. **Performance Consistency**
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash delivers the most consistent and accurate timetable parsing
   - Standardizing on one model provides more predictable results
   - The JSON response format from Gemini 2.0 is most compatible with our parser

2. **Simplified Error Recovery**
   - Since JSON truncation issues are now properly handled
   - Alternative models no longer needed as fallbacks
   - Error handling can focus on token limits and temporary API issues

3. **Enhanced JSON Handling**
   - Our advanced JSON reconstruction logic is optimized for Gemini's response patterns
   - Specifically addresses common Gemini truncation issues (around position ~10982)
   - Special handling for unterminated strings in class definitions

## Benefits

1. **Faster Response Times**
   - Eliminated time spent switching between models
   - Reduced complexity in decision-making logic
   - More predictable processing times

2. **Improved Reliability**
   - More consistent output format
   - Better handling of Gemini-specific response patterns
   - Specialized JSON reconstruction optimized for one model

3. **Simplified Maintenance**
   - Easier to update and maintain with focus on one model
   - Less conditional logic and branching
   - More straightforward debugging

## API Key Rotation

The system still maintains multiple API keys to handle token limits. When a token limit is reached with one key, the system will automatically:

1. Mark the current key as exhausted
2. Find the next non-exhausted key
3. Retry the request with the new key
4. Track exhausted keys to avoid unnecessary retries

This ensures maximum daily capacity (3000 tokens/day with 3 API keys) while maintaining reliability.
