# Parser Enhancement and OpenRouter Migration Summary

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. OpenRouter.ai Migration
- Replaced Together.ai SDK with native fetch API
- Updated API key management for OpenRouter
- Enhanced streaming response handling
- Improved error handling specific to OpenRouter's format
- Updated to latest Llama 3.3 model (8B parameters) with free tier

### 2. Browser Compatibility Fixes
- Resolved "process is not defined" errors
- Added safety checks for window.location.origin
- Improved stream handling with better error recovery
- Updated webpack configuration to handle environment variables

### 3. Multiple Classes Per Period Support
- Enhanced AI prompt to explicitly request multiple classes per period
- Improved JSON example structure to illustrate multiple classes in a period
- Updated parsing logic to preserve multiple classes in the same period
- Added duplicate detection and prevention during class redistribution
- Enhanced tabular format parser to handle multiple rows per period
- Improved fallback parser to detect and handle multiple classes

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Added more comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved code organization for maintainability
- Enhanced comments for better developer understanding
- Created test scripts to validate the parser's functionality
- Added documentation for future reference and onboarding

### 5. Prompt Optimization (May 2025)
- Simplified instructions to be more direct and focused
- Emphasized proper day/period organization
- Added explicit warnings about common parsing mistakes
- Optimized for the newer Llama 3.3 model architecture

## Technical Implementation Details

1. OpenRouter API Integration:
   ```javascript
   // Native fetch implementation
   const response = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
     headers: {...},
     body: JSON.stringify({...})
   });
   ```

2. Multiple Classes Per Period:
   ```javascript
   // Example multi-class period structure
   "Period 1": [
     {
       "subject": "Mathematics",
       "code": "10MAT101",
       "room": "B12",
       "teacher": "Mr Smith"
     },
     {
       "subject": "English",
       "code": "10ENG101",
       "room": "A08",
       "teacher": "Ms Johnson"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Smart Class Redistribution:
   ```javascript
   // Preserving multi-class periods
   if (classes.length > 1) {
     console.log(`Preserving ${classes.length} classes in Day 1 ${period} as a multi-class period`);
     // We leave these classes in Day 1, no redistribution needed
   }
   ```

4. Duplicate Prevention:
   ```javascript
   // Check for duplicates before adding
   const isDuplicate = jsonObject.classes[targetDay][period].some(existingClass => 
     existingClass.subject === cls.subject && 
     existingClass.room === cls.room && 
     existingClass.teacher === cls.teacher
   );
   
   if (!isDuplicate) {
     // Add to appropriate day
     jsonObject.classes[targetDay][period].push(cls);
   }
   ```

5. Model Update (May 2025):
   ```javascript
   // Updated to latest model with free tier
   model: "meta-llama/llama-3.3-8b-instruct:free",
   ```

## Testing

The parser has been tested with various input formats:
1. Tabular formats with days as columns
2. List formats with multiple classes per period
3. Complex formats with different styles for different days
4. Scenarios with shared classes and room codes

Test scripts have been created to validate the parser's functionality:
- `test-multiclass-parser.js` - Node.js test for the fallback parser
- `test-basic-parser.sh` - Shell script to test basic functionality
- `test-updated-parser.sh` - Script to test the 2025 model update

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- `MULTIPLE_CLASSES_PER_PERIOD.md` - Details on the multiple classes feature
- `OPENROUTER_MIGRATION.md` - Guide to the OpenRouter.ai migration
- `AI_PARSER_MULTICLASS_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Technical details of the parser enhancements
- `AI_PARSER_UPDATE_2025.md` - Information about the 2025 model update

## Future Considerations

1. Further refinement of the tabular format parser to handle more complex layouts
2. Additional heuristics to identify student groups when that information is available
3. Better handling of merged cells in tabular formats
4. Integration with a test suite that runs during the build process
5. Performance optimization for large timetables
6. Adaptive model selection based on timetable complexity and token budget
